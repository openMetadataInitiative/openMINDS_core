# openMINDS_core

The **openMINDS_core** repository hosts one of the metadata models of the **openMINDS metadata framework**. It defines modular metadata schemas for describing the general origin, location and content of neuroscience research products.

To generally learn more about the openMINDS metadata framework please go to :arrow_right: [**ReadTheDocs**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io).  
For browsing through the metadata schemas you can also directly jump to the :arrow_right: [**openMINDS core Specifications**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specifications/core.html).

The openMINDS metadata framework also offers libraries for serviceable, well-defined metadata instances for [**content types**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries/contentTypes.html) and [**licenses**](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries/licenses.html).
