# How to contribute <a name="top"/>

openMINDS is by design an open-source, community-driven project incorporating input and feedback from all community members independent of their scientific background.

**Do not be shy!** We, the openMINDS development team, rely on you, as a community member, to get in touch if you have general feedback or a request for a new feature, want to report a bug or have a question. Depending on the type of message for us, you can either contact us via our support-email or via an issue on our GitHub repositories. You are also welcome to contribute to discussion in the issue tracker.

For more details please go to: [Report & ask questions](#report-questions)

**Help us directly!** Contributions from outside the openMINDS development team are always very welcome. If you spot a bug and know how to fix it, if you want to extend existing schemas and/or metadata models, or develop new schemas and/or metadata models, feel free to fork this repository and open a pull request with your changes. For larger changes, please raise an issue beforehand to get feedback from the openMINDS development team and the community.

For more details please go to: [Direct contributions](#direct-contributions)

**Be nice!** Contributing to openMINDS should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Report & ask questions <a name="report-questions"/>

In particular, general feedback and questions are welcome through our support-email: **`openminds@ebrains.eu`** (not active yet)

It is also possible to request new features or report bugs this way, but in these cases we prefer if you could raise an issue on the respective GitHub repository (see below).

If you write us an email, please make sure that you provide a meaningful subject that describes your concern. If your concern is not of general nature, please name the affected GitHub repository and file in your email. In particular for bug reports, provide us with a screen shot or copy of your error message (where applicable). 

You can also report and ask questions through the issue tracker of this GitHub repository. However, if your concern is of general nature or affecting the central openMINDS repository, please consider raising an issue on the central openMINDS repository instead.

If you raise an issue, please make sure that you provide a short meaningful title and a more detailed description that declares your concern. In particular for bug reports, provide us with a screen shot or copy of your error message (where applicable).

## Direct contributions <a name="direct-contributions"/>

If you want to contribute to the openMINDS_core repository directly, feel free to fork it and open pull requests with your changes. Note, that larger changes and new features should be first raised and discussed as an issue before making a pull request. Minor bug fixes can, of course, still be made directly as a pull request without raising an issue first. Direct contributions to one of the other openMINDS metadata models, the openMINDS generator or openMINDS (central) should be made on the respective GitHub repository.

Please be aware that on any openMINDS version branch which has an official release tag in place, only backwards compatible changes are accepted. This can include corrections of typos in instructions, introduction of additional properties to schemas, loosening constraints on expected value numbers or formats, granting additional relations between schemas, and adding new schemas (if they do not require relational changes in existing schemas). Except for typo corrections, these changes (if accepted) are typically later tagged as sub-releases for the respective major version (e.g., v1.1) by the openMINDS development team. 

Non-backwards compatible changes are only accepted for version branches that do not have an official release tag yet, or lead to the creation of a new version branch (with a respectively increased major version number). This is true for renaming of existing properties, increasing constraints on expected value numbers or formats, removing relations between schemas and adding new schemas, if they cause relational changes in existing schemas.

For all contributions, make sure that you describe well what you plan to do / have done to speed up the evaluation / review process of your issue / pull request. The assigned member of the openMINDS development team will get back to you as soon as possible to discuss or give the blessing to your contribution. Note that, all contributing community members are welcome to provide comments on active issues and pull requests. 

**Guidelines to suggesting new content types:** The library of openMINDS content types contains official and unofficial media types (also known as 'MIME-types', or file formats). The goal of the openMINDS content types is to commonly define software specific input and output formats to be able to properly link respective data. Sometimes this means to define a subtype of an official media type, because a specific content is expected for a software. For example, the generic JSON media type (application/json) does not specify what data it has to contain to qualify as an input format for a specific software.

In order to register software specific content types in openMINDS, we use the following naming convention (which is more-or-less in line with [RFC6838](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838)):

    application/vnd.{ app_name }.{ sub_type }[.{ optional_sub_sub_type }]
    
This is what Microsoft used, for example, for the media type for “.docx”:

    application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document

Where the format uses a standardised container format, such as XML, JSON, HDF5, we add +{ container_format }, e.g.

    application/vnd.nwb.nwbn+hdf

for the NWB:N format, which uses HDF5 as its container (which means that a generic HDF-5 reader will be able to read such a file). You can also follow the same principle if you want to highlight the base media type of the specific content type. 

Where a standard media type does exist, but there are standard sub-types which don’t have their own specific media type (e.g. TIFF), we suggest extending the existing content type, e.g.

    image/tiff.multichannel
    image/tiff.multipage
    
For new suggestions of content types, just raise an issue or make a pull request on this GitHub. To accelerate the review process, make sure to provide information of the software this content type should be registered for, provide the purpose of the data in this content type, and add a short description of the content type specifications or (if available) add a link to where the content type specificiations are documented.
